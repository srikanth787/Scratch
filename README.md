When deploying DDN Exascaler with Lustre, you have the option of using one large file system or multiple smaller file systems. Each approach has its own advantages and disadvantages.

Single Lustre File System

Pros
	1.	Simplified Management
	•	Easier to administer since you only have one namespace to manage.
	•	No need for cross-mounting or multiple metadata servers for different file systems.
	2.	Better Storage Utilization
	•	All available storage can be dynamically allocated to workloads as needed.
	•	Avoids fragmentation of unused space across multiple file systems.
	3.	Consistent Performance Across Workloads
	•	Performance tuning can be done at a global level for predictable performance.
	•	Load balancing is easier because all clients access the same pool of resources.
	4.	Easier Client Configuration
	•	Clients only need to mount a single file system, reducing complexity.
	•	No need to determine which file system a particular dataset resides in.
	5.	Simpler User Access Control
	•	Centralized management of permissions and policies.

Cons
	1.	Scalability Bottlenecks
	•	Metadata server (MDS) can become a bottleneck as the number of files and I/O requests increase.
	•	High metadata operations (e.g., small file workloads) can overwhelm a single MDS.
	2.	Limited Performance Isolation
	•	A single workload can consume excessive resources, impacting other users.
	•	Lack of workload isolation for different applications.
	3.	Harder to Enforce QoS (Quality of Service)
	•	No separation of different teams, projects, or workloads at the file system level.
	•	Harder to implement different performance tuning strategies for different workloads.
	4.	More Complex Disaster Recovery
	•	A single file system failure could impact all users.
	•	Upgrades and maintenance require a global downtime unless you have redundancy.

Multiple Lustre File Systems

Pros
	1.	Performance Isolation
	•	Each file system has its own MDS and OSTs, preventing a single workload from overwhelming the entire system.
	•	Different applications or users can have dedicated resources.
	2.	Scalability and Redundancy
	•	More metadata servers can be used to scale independently.
	•	If one file system fails, others remain operational.
	3.	Workload-Specific Optimization
	•	Different file systems can be tuned for different workloads (e.g., one optimized for large files, another for small files).
	•	Can configure different striping and storage policies.
	4.	Easier Upgrades and Maintenance
	•	You can upgrade or take down one file system while others remain available.
	•	Reduces the risk of global downtime.
	5.	Improved Multi-Tenancy
	•	Different projects, teams, or applications can have their own isolated environments.
	•	Security and quota management can be more granular.

Cons
	1.	Higher Administrative Overhead
	•	More file systems mean more configurations, monitoring, and maintenance.
	•	Clients need to mount multiple file systems manually or use an auto-mount system.
	2.	Fragmented Storage Utilization
	•	Some file systems may fill up while others have free space, leading to inefficient usage.
	•	Need manual reallocation or balancing.
	3.	More Complex Disaster Recovery
	•	Managing backups and restores across multiple file systems adds complexity.
	•	Each file system might have its own recovery procedure.
	4.	Increased Metadata Overhead
	•	Each file system requires its own MDS, which can introduce additional hardware and management overhead.

Which Approach Should You Choose?
	•	Use a Single File System If:
	•	Your workloads are well-balanced and do not require strong isolation.
	•	You want simplicity in management and storage allocation.
	•	You expect to scale in terms of storage rather than the number of metadata operations.
	•	Use Multiple File Systems If:
	•	You need performance isolation between different workloads or teams.
	•	Your workloads have different performance characteristics (e.g., large sequential I/O vs. metadata-intensive operations).
	•	You want easier upgrades and maintenance without affecting all users.
	•	You need better resilience to failures by distributing risk across multiple systems.

Given that you are managing DDN Exascaler, which scales well, you might want to start with one large file system and partition later if you notice performance bottlenecks or need more isolation.
